## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo in your dev directory via your git interface or via your CLI (Command Line Interface). I personally use [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/).

2. Once you are in the repo directory download node packages : `(sudo) npm install` or `(sudo) npm i`. It will download all the packages listed in the `package.json` situated at the root of the project.

3. When you're done you can compile the assets and start the server by running the `gulp` command.
